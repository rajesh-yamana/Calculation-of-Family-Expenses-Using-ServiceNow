# 💰 Calculation of Family Expenses Using ServiceNow

This project focuses on developing a centralized and automated **Family Expense Management System** using the ServiceNow platform. The system enables efficient tracking, management, and aggregation of daily and family-level expenses through custom tables, automated business rules, and structured workflows. By leveraging ServiceNow's application development capabilities, this project provides a scalable and organized solution for managing financial records and improving expense visibility.

## 📊 Project Overview

Managing family expenses manually can lead to errors, lack of transparency, and difficulty in tracking spending patterns. The objective of this project is to design and implement a structured expense management system using ServiceNow that allows users to:

- Record and manage daily expenses efficiently  
- Automatically calculate and aggregate family-level expenses  
- Maintain structured and organized financial records  
- Improve visibility and transparency of expense data  
- Automate expense calculations using ServiceNow Business Rules  
- Demonstrate real-world ServiceNow application development concepts  

To achieve this, the following components were implemented:

- Custom tables for storing Family Expenses and Daily Expenses  
- Configured forms for structured and user-friendly data entry  
- Implemented auto-numbering for unique record identification  
- Created relationships between tables using reference fields  
- Configured related lists to maintain hierarchical data structure  
- Developed business rules to automatically calculate and update total expenses  
- Organized data model for efficient data management and reporting  

This project demonstrates the complete lifecycle of ServiceNow application development including requirement analysis, planning, design, implementation, testing, and deployment.

## 🏗 System Architecture and Components

### 1. Custom Tables Created

**Family Expenses Table**
- Stores family-level expense records
- Contains aggregated total expenses
- Maintains relationship with daily expense records

**Daily Expenses Table**
- Stores individual daily expense entries
- Linked to Family Expenses table using reference field
- Used for calculating family-level total expenses

---

### 2. Form Configuration

- Designed user-friendly forms for data entry
- Enabled structured input for expense records
- Improved usability and data consistency

---

### 3. Auto-numbering

- Configured auto-generated unique identifiers
- Ensures each expense record is uniquely identifiable
- Improves record management and tracking

---

### 4. Table Relationships and Related Lists

- Established relationship between Family Expenses and Daily Expenses tables
- Used reference fields to connect related records
- Configured related lists to display daily expenses under family expense records

---

### 5. Business Rule Automation

Implemented business rules to:

- Automatically calculate total family expenses
- Update family expense record when daily expenses are added, updated, or deleted
- Maintain data consistency and eliminate manual calculations

This automation improves efficiency and reduces human errors.
